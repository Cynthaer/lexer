	-	divides string into tokens, filters out separators (white space, comments)
	-	make things easier for syntax analysis phase
		-	efficiency: may be faster and smaller than combining with syntax analysis
		-	modularity: unclutter syntax definition with whitespace, etc.
		-	tradition: languages often designed with expectation of separate phases, documented accordingly
	-	generally created by lexer generators, which translate specs into programs

-	regex
